Created the 1st weekly plan. I had talked with both Robbie and Anish to come up with a strong tactic to obtain evidence of Mr. Kocher's alleged crime. 
Without much options I feel like our tactics would be vague at first, but soon develop more as more specifics are given to us.

Now that we were given more information, we should focus on figuring out how to decrypt the email, so we researched the different types of encryption.
Cracking down on how to efficiently decrypt the email is our number one priority at the moment, until we get more information.

Given that we have permission to hack the email account we will
research the manner in which Mr. Kocher email is encrypted and learn
more about hash's in order to aid us

After learning that the email was encrypted using MD5 we will work on
a script using hash's to find the password. A common problem that we
are encountering is how to read the whole file that was given to us to
use to crack the password. A solution we will work towards is breaking
up the file into smaller protions to read.

Our plan to find the setting of the distribution of Phillips content
is to use a sftp to get the file data without reading the contents to
make sure Mr. Kocher is unaware. We will than attempt to get the data
from the potential file to find the distrubution means and setting.

We executed our plan and tracked the setting of Mr. Kocher's
distrubution, gaining emough evidence to prove him guilty of possesing
child pornography.
