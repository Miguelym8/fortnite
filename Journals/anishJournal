Today I hatched a plan with my group in order to catch the culprit. We
analyzed the best option in order to gain evidence against the
culprits actions as well as consequences and chose the best plan to
with the least of these consequences.

With the new information given by our supervisor we were able to plot
a plan to actually decrypt the email based on the type of encryption
that was given, either TLS/SSL or end to end encryption. We could use
this as concrete evidence towards proving the suspect of possession of
child pornography.

Given that we have permission to hack the email account we will
research the manner in which Mr. Kocher email is encrypted and learn
more about hash's in order to aid us

After learning that the email was encrypted using MD5 we will work on
a script using hash's to find the password. A common problem that we
are encountering is how to read the whole file that was given to us to
use to crack the password. A solution we will work towards is breaking
up the file into smaller protions to read.
