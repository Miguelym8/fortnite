The main objective is to be able to catch the culprit who has
possession of child pornography. In order to to do so legally, we need
proper evidence in order to bring him to custody. To do so I beieve
that the best plan to do so is to catfish the culprit into doing so. I
came to this conclusion after realizing that getting the suspect,
Philip A. Kocher, to admit to his actions would be close to
impossible. So rather we plan to disguise someone as a possible
"target" to get mr. Kocher to possibly get more possesion of child
pornography. If he were to take the "bait" it would give evidence of
him being an offender and we could attempt to use it as evidence to
get permission to search for possesion of other child pornography. We
continue to tempt him until he takes the bait.
