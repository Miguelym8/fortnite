With our plan of cat-fishing the offender is off to a good start with
Supervisor, Christopher Wary, providing us with the information that
Philip A. Kocher has recieved encrypted emails to an account
@codermerlin.com. Due to the fact that we've been tipped of him having
child pornography, we can assume that this could relate to the
evidence that we needed. Yet we cannot assume this as good enough
evidence to bring him into custody, so to do so we need to find what
the encrypted email contains within it. Depending on the method of
encryption we would be able to decrypt the email. If the email was
encrypted using a Transport Layer Security (TLS) we would be able to
decrypt it using softwares such as wireshark. If it was encrypted
using end to end encrption it would be very hard to hack the email
contents while being delivered but we could attack the endpoints
themselves.
