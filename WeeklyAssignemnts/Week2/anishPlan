With our plan of cat-fishing the offender is off to a good start with
Supervisor, Christopher Wary, providing us with the information that
Philip A. Kocher has recieved encrypted emails to an account
@codermerlin.com. Due to the fact that we've been tipped of him having
child pornography, we can assume that this could relate to the
evidence that we needed. Yet we cannot assume this as good enough
evidence to bring him into custody, so to do so we need to find what
the encrypted email contains within it.
