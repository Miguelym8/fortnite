Our plan to find the password is to first find the method of
encryption, after finding the encryption method we plan to run a
script against a list of all possible passwords which will be supplied
to us in the form of a dictionary. Using the password we will be able
to enter the contents of potential evidence of Mr. Kocher's alleged
crimes.
